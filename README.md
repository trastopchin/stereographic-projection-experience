# A Stereographic Projection Experience

"A Stereographic Projection Experience" is a Unity game that interactively guides a player through the construction and exploration of Möbius transformations using stereographic projection.

This project constitutes the second half of a semester independent study on symmetry groups. You can read [my paper](https://github.com/trastopchin/stereographic-projection-experience/blob/main/resources/stereographic_projection_experience_paper.pdf) motivating and explaining the game experience as well as watch a [playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhiEGtMBaIg) of the experience.


In the first half of the independent study I worked through about half of Dr. Keith Carne's reading notes for a course entitled Geometry and Groups which explores symmetry groups. Carne motivates and builds up to the construction of hyperbolic geometry through an investigation of metric spaces and their isometries. In the second half I reflected on what I learned to design and build a game experience that immerses a player in some of the concepts I read about. The game experience, which I call "Stereographic Projection Experience," interactively guides the player through the construction of stereographic projection, the construction of  Möbius transformations using stereographic projections, and some properties of Möbius transformations. A major design goal of the experience was to go beyond interactive visualization by directly engaging with important definitions and proofs.
