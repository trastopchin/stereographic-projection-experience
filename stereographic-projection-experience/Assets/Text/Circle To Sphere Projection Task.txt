Great job! Hopefully you've started to get the hang of translating and rotating the Riemann sphere.

In your next task you will create a MÃ¶bius transformation. You will do this by performing some sequence of projections to and from the Riemann sphere interspersed with translations and rotations of the Riemann sphere.

You already know how to translate and rotate the Riemann sphere (left-click and drag the gizmos!). In your next task you will see a black circle in front of you. To stereographically project the black circle onto the Riemann sphere, press the Q key. Give it a try!
