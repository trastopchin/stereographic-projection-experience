Hello! Welcome to "A Stereographic Projection Experience." You can navigate through these text blocks using the "Back" and "Forward" buttons. Feel free to use the "Back" button to navigate to a previous slide at any point. When you are ready, click the "Forward" button to move to the next block.

In this experience you will interactively build functions from the plane to itself known as MÃ¶bius transformations. You will build these functions geometrically by projecting the plane onto a sphere, translating and rotating the sphere, and then re-projecting the sphere back onto the plane.

To start the experience, let's orient you. You will be an observer standing on the plane. You will be able to look around by left-clicking and dragging the mouse. Your first task will be to turn around and find a glowing sphere behind you. Click it! Press "Forward" to begin your task.
