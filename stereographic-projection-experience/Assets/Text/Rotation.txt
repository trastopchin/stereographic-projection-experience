Great job! The arrow gizmos allow you to translate the Riemann sphere along the x, y, or z axes.

Now the other three overlayed gizmos are circles that allow you to rotate the Riemann sphere.

To rotate the Riemann sphere, hover your mouse over one of the circle gizmos. When one of the circle gizmos is highlighted, you can left-click and drag your mouse to rotate the Riemann sphere along the axis of that gizmo.

Why don't you give it a try. Using the inner colored cube to see what you are doing, rotate the Riemann sphere some "significant" amount.
