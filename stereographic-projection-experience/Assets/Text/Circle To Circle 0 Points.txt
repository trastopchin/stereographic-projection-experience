Like I said before, the first property you will explore is the fact that a Möbius transformation can send any circle in the plane to any other circle in the plane.

In your next task you will see a black player circle and a yellow target circle. Your goal will be to construct a Möbius transformation that takes the black player circle to the yellow target circle.

You will do this by performing some sequence of projections to and from the Riemann sphere interspersed with translations and rotations of the Riemann sphere. Good luck!
