Your next task will be to learn how to translate and rotate the Riemann sphere. Let's start with translation.

Now the blue Riemann sphere in front of you looks a little different. Firstly, it has a colored cube at its center. This cube will help you visualize how you translate and rotate the Riemann sphere.

Secondly, the Riemann sphere has a bunch of transparent gizmos overlayed on top of it. Three of these gizmos are arrows that allow you to translate the Riemann sphere.

To translate the Riemann sphere, hover your mouse over one of arrow gizmos. When one of the arrow gizmos is highlighted, you can left-click and drag your mouse to translate the Riemann sphere along the axis of that gizmo.

Why don't you give it a try. Move the Riemann sphere some "significant" distance away from where it currently floats.
